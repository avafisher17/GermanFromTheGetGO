                <p>It's a new way to jump-start your language skills without having to slog through the boring bits!</p>
                <p>"Hello." "My name is..." "Please and thank you."</p>
                <p>Of course these tid-bits of language are important, but let's be real - that's what phrase books are for!</p>
                <p><span class="title">German From the Get-GO</span> is designed to get you understanding and using the language right away, giving you
                the building blocks to create with the language, not just translate!</p>

            <div class="about2">
                <h3 class="sectionhead">How is <span class="title">German From the Get-GO</span> different from other courses?</h3>

                <p>You've probably used other language-learning apps before. Like that one with the owl. Yeah, you know the one!</p>
                <p><span class="title">German From the Get-GO</span> is different from most other apps because they use a translation-based approach.
                Their model is "here's a sentence - now how do you say it in another language?"</p>
                <p><p><span class="title">German From the Get-GO</span>, on the other hand, focuses on what's called "comprehensible output". It gives you a
                question, and you use what you've learned to answer it. This gets you creating your own sentences and recalling your knowledge in more realistic
                scenarios - which leads to you putting your skills to better use!</p>

                <p>The content from <span class="title">German From the Get-GO</span> isn't just hobbled together by AI.</p>
                <p>It's been designed by an actual
                    German instructor who studied foreign language aquisition - one who has lived, worked, and taught abroad! The methods used in this course
                    are student-tested and approved, so you're guaranteed to learn and still have some fun doing it!</p>
